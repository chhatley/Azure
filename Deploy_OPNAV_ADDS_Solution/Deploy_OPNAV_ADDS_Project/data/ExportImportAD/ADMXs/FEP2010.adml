      <string id="nis_consumers_ips_disablesignatureretirement">Turn on definition retirement</string>
      <string id="nis_consumers_ips_disablesignatureretirement_explain">This policy setting allows you to configure definition retirement for network protection against exploits of known vulnerabilities. Definition retirement checks to see if a computer has the required security updates necessary to protect it against a particular vulnerability. If the system is not vulnerable to the exploit detected by a definition, then that definition is "retired". If all definitions for a given protocal are retired then that protocol is no longer parsed. Enabling this feature helps to improve performance. On a computer that is up-to-date with all the latest security updates, network protection will have no impact on network performance.
